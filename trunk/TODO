(Critical is something like crashes and so on)
* No critical bugs known... but maybe there are some...

* URGENT: rewrite the hamlib support code!!!
* URGENT: The way the awards are deleted is not very smart.
The list calls to writeconf and readconf when a award is deleted so if a user
makes any modification in any other field in the setup GUI, it is saved!
URGENT: * To add a button to active the Hamlib once it has been disabled if it was actived in the setup.

* AWARDS: worked/confirmed reference
	delete a QSO includes delete a reference
	is worked?

* OPTIMIZATION: When QSL Managing, it is slow between you accept/send a QSL
and you can continue... What is done in between???
* OPTIMIZATION:  When clicking over OK button, it re-paint the loglist
completely. I should just "add" a new QSO and not re-reading the whole log.
* OPTIMIZATION: The showLogList() should be in background! to allow the update while using KLog at the same time
* OPTIMIZATION: Check in the QSL-rec functions the confirmed/dxcc.confirmed/notconfirmed... there is no need to check if it is confirmed before setting as not confirmed!



* BUG??????????: To check if remarks is also copied when "complete from previous QSO" as today it IS copied.
* BUG: RST is a String, Aurora QSOs must be 59A (TNX SM5CNQ)
* BUG: When adding an award, if the file is not in the .klog dir, it does not work.
* BUG: Re-Write the hamlib support!

To check the Debian package as I think icons are not being included (s390/0.3.01)
http://buildd.debian.org/fetch.php?&pkg=klog&ver=0.3.0-1&arch=s390&stamp=1099872133&file=log&as=raw

* Possible fix: To solve the year 2000 date "problem" when importing data from TLF... if the last two digits of the QSO date is "older" than the actual date, then we are importing a 19xx date QSO. (TNX Fermin)
                Another solution could be just to ask the user about the
		first two digits when finding a 2-digit year.

URGENT: * To add a button to active the Hamlib once it has been disabled if it was actived in the setup.

There are so many thinks to do in KLog:

<working now in>
* Working in the dxpot class to add a bandmap from the dxcluster
* To implement the remove award slot in Setup Class

* To add some qmessages in the kloghamlib class to show the errors and warnings. Replace fprintf with qmessages.
* showIfPreviouslyWorked(): Create the new tab, ... and read the comments in the klog.cpp file
* Add a box or whatever to show talks and announces from the DX-Cluster
* Working in the class qslneeded
* V/UHF support (locators, distances, Grids...)
* Reviewing the workflow/diagram of QSL rec/sent

</working now in>

<bugs>
* It is not possible to log the QSO without using the mouse. (it is not
possible to reach the Name and QTH with tabs) (P.H. Rankin H.)
* The left "led" depends on the dxcluster selected, should depend on the
  call on the QRZ input box
* It is necesary to run klog from a directory with icons to have them in the rightButton actions.
</bugs>

                   
<Early versions - WishList>
* Include a TIP on the start of KLog. Showing there is a mailinglist...
* Include another tag in the bottom box to add a list of needed DXSpots to void loosing them if the DXCluster traffic is high (something like a bandmap of contest software) ;-)
* Include in the DXCluster menu some kind of filters to filter the DXCluster spots by band, mode, ... only spots from my continent.
* Add in the menu some kind of IARU band plan just as information
* To include a "Send to DX-Cluster" button so it is possible to automaticaly send a QSO as a spot to the DX-Cluster. Maybe it is necessary to ask for the frecuency and comments ;-)
* Add a tag to control the rig via Hamlib. Enter frecuency, modes, ...
* Make configurable the date period (when using two digits for the year) to know if we are importing a 19xx or a 2xxx year. It could solve the problem of TLF log imports.
* Two timers to save QSO duration. (TNX: P.H. Rankin Hansen)
* Mode selection by keyboard (use of acelerators). (TNX: P.H. Rankin Hansen)
* Be able to configure the modes that are going to use. (TNX: P.H. Rankin Hansen)
* A kind of association between "band+mode+power"... to ease operation (TNX: P.H. Rankin Hansen)
* Control 2 VFO and allow saving freqs..
* Save the frecuency if hamlib is being used
* A "bye" message when disconnecting from cluster to "announce KLog" Maybe a ann/local message
* a way to make KLog to tell you what QSOs are with a needed and you have not send the QSL.
* When importing from TLF save STX and SRX (serials tx/rx in contest).
* Second frecuency when working satellite.

> 6. Although I can imagine it is not that easy to realize, how about

* To select an Entity and show the QSOs with that Entity
* When QSL managing, it would be nice to have the state of the QSO selection
in other place than just the color as when selected it is not noticed.
* Offer the option in DX-Cluster to "save" spots to another list in order to
  work them later. (Useful when more that one needed spot appears or in days
  with much DX activity.
* Doc for KLog
* QSL "contribution$" needed? support
* Import/export from/to tlf(only export is missing), xlog, cabrillo
* Awards: managing awards as IOTA, WAS, WAZ, WAE, TPEA, ...
* Satellite support
* In tlfReadLog() the year checking is only valid till 2009!!! (should be fixed before) ;-)
* Protect KLog against bad formatted data (ie IOTA in the QSO class)

</Early versions - WishList>


<Not so soon - WishList>
* Add in the setup the possibility to crete the station and from the log to
select the rig you are using to do the QSO. (P.H. Rankin H.)
* Power is an int when reading from klogrc but an string in the rest of the program.
* Multi call support, the same user can log with several calls (OPERATOR)
* Look for QSL information on the Internet (qsl manager on-line data base???)
* Contest calendar from Internet?
</Not so soon - WishList>

<ke6sls>
1.  cty.dat isn't copied to users directory on first startup.
2.  /usr/share/klog/cty.dat *does not exist* in .deb package.
3.  Can not specify frequency--example: 14.233MHz
4.  Tab doesn't move from one part of Klog to the next:
    from callsign/mode/freq box will not skip [tab] to RST box.

Wish list:
1.  Simple log screen where I can quickly tab from one
    field to next with the TAB button on keyboard to
    include the following entries:
    NAME/CITY/STATE-PROVINCE/COUNTRY/RST(auto-switch
    between CW/SSB)/FREQUENCY/MODE/POWER then seperate
    areas for further details like Remarks/QSL/WAS/WAC/etc
2.  Enable manual entry for Modes and Frequency. Example:
    psk64 12.1055MHz (for those who want exact info)
3.  Start/stop qso time duration.
4.  Add splash screen asking for log file to open.
5.  Help documentation under the HELP menu.
8.  Add more import options for other logs like winlog and
    log-eqf data!  It would be wonderful to be able to
    import my old log-eqf data into klog.

WISHLIST

- four widgets for entering QSO data are impractical to handle. Consider
keeping important things at one - date, time, mode, band or freq., RS(T),
QTH, and name. In other widget could be QSL info, other data and remarks.

- It will be so good for me if the statistics about DXCC, WAZ and other could
work by bands, modes and "mixed", depending on actual award rules.

QRZ, Name, QTH
