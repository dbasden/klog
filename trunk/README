This is my very first KDE program.
The main reason of developing KLog is to learn how to use Qt and KDELibs and also
to have a ham log program just as i like it to be. :-)

If you have any idea, you want to help translating into your language or you have
any comment it will be welcome.
At this moment, KLog is in several languages:
English (TNX EA4TV)
Spanish (TNX EA4TV)
German (TNX DL5PD)
Portuguese BR (Josenivaldo Benito)
Portuguese (TNX CT1DRB)
Servian (TNX YU1IS)
Swedish (TNX Peter Landgren)

Look at the Changelog file to see what is done.

You can download the last version of KLog from:

http://jaime.robles.es/klog
https://developer.berlios.de/projects/klog/

Logs are saved in ~/.klog/klog.adi by default but you can change it.

You should run klog from a directory with the "cty.dat" file to allow klog
to read the data.
You can find the last cty.dat file at:
http://www.country-files.com/cty/

You can find the last hamlib package at:
http://hamlib.sourceforge.net/

Thanks for using KLog!
