Follow these steps to build klog.

1. Check if you have the necessary include files to develop KDE4
application. This means include files for QT and KDE4.

2. Check if you have the necessary include files to develop applications
with hamlib. This mean that you need the include files of hamlib:
http://hamlib.sourceforge.net or install the hamlib-dev package of your
distribution.

3. Create a build folder in the klog folder and change to this folder.

    mkdir build; cd build;

4. Prepare the build files using cmake. Change the installation prefix if needed.

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

5. Make everything.

    make

5.5 (JUST FOR INFORMATION)

    You will find the klog executable in the "build/src" folder.

6. If you want, install the program as root.

   su
   make install (if you are not root, try: su -c 'make install' but you will need the root password!)

7. To uninstall the project:

   make uninstall (or su -c 'make uninstall')

8. Once you have KLog installed, please copy the following files into your
~/.klog directory:
  data/klog-contest-cabrillo-formats.txt	(to be able to import cabrillo files)
  awa/tpea.awa					(to be able to manage the TPEA award)
  awa/was.awa					(to be able to manage the WAS award)
  http://www.country-files.com/cty/cty.dat	(to be able to identify the entities from the call)

You can get more data files and updated ones from the KLog's homepage.
