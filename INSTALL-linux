Follow these steps to build KLog.

1. Check if you have the necessary include files to compile QT5 applications.
	- Qt 	- http://qt-project.org/
	- CMake - http://wiki.qtcentre.org/index.php?title=Compiling%5FQt4%5Fapps%5Fwith%5FCMake

2. Double-check your Qt configuration to ensure that Qt5 is being used. You can check it with:

	qtchooser -print-env

On a Debian system, the output would be something like:
	QT_SELECT="default"
	QTTOOLDIR="/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/qt5/bin"
	QTLIBDIR="/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu"

In your system it may be different but ensure you are not using Qt4 to build.

3.- Generate the Makefile
 
    qmake PREFIX=/usr/local klog.pro

4. Make everything.

    make 

5 (JUST FOR INFORMATION)

    You will find the klog executable in the sources folder.
